Instead of HTML I am using EJS Templating Language on top of my html

HTML/EJS files found in /pages
CSS, and JS found in /public

Steps to run:
1. Download and Install Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Reset terminal and type the following:
	npm i

3. After node packages are installed... type:
	npm run start

4. Open browser and navigate to localhost:8080
